# My personal web directory

Back in the old days, we used the Yahoo web directory to find stuff. And for the most part, it worked. Then we moved to Google, and that worked really well, but these days most of Google's search results are garbage. I've been building up a directory of websites that provide me with news (about many different topics) and useful reference information. I'm making my web directory public in case anyone else wants to use it. Even better, if you think this is useful, create your own publicly-accessible web directory.

Note: This doesn't include very many sites directly related to economics. I'm not entirely sure why, but it's probably because I don't need a directory of those sites.
